# RbxShader
A robust shader engine, for everyone

*As of May 18, 2024, the shader only contains a fragment shader.

The shader can run virtually any shader program that can run on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), and porting is relatively easy due to their code structuring being !
similar. If you wish to test the abilities of this shader, you can use the [sample shader program provided](https://github.com/AnotherSubatomo/RbxShader/blob/main/Shaders/VoxelShader.lua), which are also ports of pre-existing shader programs in Shadertoy ðŸ˜Š.

If you have an eye for possible optimizations, or how the shader could be better in any way, please feel free to contribute as **this project is open-source and is open for contribution.**

#### The shader features/provides:
- The ability to interlace your renders
- Partial re-implementation of GLSL functions (no [_swizzling_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swizzling_(computer_graphics)) tho)
- Multithreading
- Support for multiple buffers
- User input handling

#### Features that are planned to be implemented:
- Make rendering go **more** brr

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "RbxShader.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `RbxShader.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
